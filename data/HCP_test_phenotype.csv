PicSeq_Unadj,NIH Toolbox Picture Sequence Memory Test: Unadjusted Scale Score,"The Picture Sequence Memory Test is an assessment of episodic memory for ages 3-85 years which involves the acquisition, storage and effortful recall of new information. It is considered a strong 'fluid ability' measure, with performance reaching a peak in early adulthood and declining across the life span. It involves recalling increasingly lengthy series of illustrated objects and activities that are presented in a particular order on the computer screen. Unadjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed to those in the entire NIH Toolbox Normative Sample (18 and older), regardless of age or any other variable, where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average."
CardSort_AgeAdj,NIH Toolbox Dimensional Change Card Sort Test: Age-Adjusted Scale Score,"The Dimensional Change Card Sort Test is a measure of executive function, specifically tapping cognitive flexibility for ages 3-85. DCCS is considered a 'fluid ability' measure, with performance generally increasing through childhood and then declining across the adult age span. Target pictures are presented that vary along two dimensions (e.g., shape and color). Participants are asked to match a series of bivalent test pictures (e.g., yellow balls and blue trucks) to the target pictures, first according to one dimension (e.g., color) and then, after a number of trials, according to the other dimension (e.g., shape). Switch trials are also employed, in which the participant must change the dimension being matched, thus requiring the cognitive flexibility to quickly choose the correct stimulus. Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time. Age-Adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band. "
Flanker_AgeAdj,NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test: Age-Adjusted Scale Score,"The Flanker is a measure of executive function, specifically tapping inhibitory control and attention for ages 3-85. It is considered a fluid ability measure (i.e. measures the capacity for new learning and information processing in novel situations) in which performance reaches a peak in early adulthood, then tends to decline across the life span. The test requires the participant to focus on a given stimulus while inhibiting attention to stimuli (arrows for ages 8-85) flanking it. Sometimes the middle stimulus is pointing in the same direction as the flankers (congruent) and sometimes in the opposite direction (incongruent). Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time. Age-Adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band."
PMAT24_A_CR,Penn Progressive Matrices: Number of Correct Responses (PMAT24_A_CR),"Penn Matrix Test (PMAT): Number of Correct Responses. The PMAT measures fluid intelligence via non-verbal reasoning using an abbreviated version of the Raven's Progressive Matrices Form A developed by Gur and colleagues (Bilker et al. 2012).  Participants are presented with patterns made up of 2x2, 3x3 or 1x5 arrangements of squares, with one of the squares missing.  The participant must pick one of five response choices that best fits the missing square on the pattern.  The task has 24 items and 3 bonus items, arranged in order of increasing difficulty.  However, the task discontinues if the participant makes 5 incorrect responses in a row."
ReadEng_AgeAdj,NIH Toolbox Oral Reading Recognition Test: Age-Adjusted Scale Score,"The Reading Test is a CAT format measure of reading decoding skill and of crystallized abilities, those abilities that are generally more dependent upon past learning experiences and consistent across the life span for ages 7-85. The participant is asked to read and pronounce letters and words as accurately as possible. Higher scores indicate better reading ability. Age-adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band. "
PicVocab_AgeAdj,NIH Toolbox Picture Vocabulary Test: Age-Adjusted Scale Score,"The Picture Vocabulary Test is a CAT format measure of general vocabulary knowledge for ages 3-85 and is considered to be a strong measure of crystallized abilities (those abilities that are more dependent upon past learning experiences and are consistent across the lifespan). The participant is presented with an audio recording of a word and four photographic images on the computer screen and is asked to select the picture that most closely matches the meaning of the word. Higher scores indicate higher vocabulary ability. Age-adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band.

DDisc_SV_1yr_200,Delay Discounting: Subjective Value for $200 at 1 year (DDisc_SV_1yr_200),"Delay Discounting: Subjective Value for $200 at 1 year. Participants choice of an immediate amount that is equivalent to receiving $200 in 1 year. In this task, participants are presented with two choices on each trial - a smaller amount today or $200 in 1 year. Using an adjusting-amount approach, delays are fixed and reward amounts are adjusted on a trial-by-trial basis based on participants choices, to rapidly hone in on an indifference point that indicates the Subjective immediate Value of $200 in 1 year. Delay discounting describes the undervaluing of rewards that are delayed in time. It is illustrated by the fact that humans (and other animals) will often choose a smaller immediate reward over an objectively larger, but delayed reward. "

ListSort_Unadj,NIH Toolbox List Sorting Working Memory Test: Unadjusted Scale Score,"This task assesses working memory and requires the participant to sequence different visually- and orally-presented stimuli (foods and animals) into size order. List Sorting is a measure of working memory, tapping both information processing and storage.
