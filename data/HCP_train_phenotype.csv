PicSeq_AgeAdj,NIH Toolbox Picture Sequence Memory Test: Age-Adjusted Scale Score,"The Picture Sequence Memory Test is an assessment of episodic memory for ages 3-85 years which involves the acquisition, storage and effortful recall of new information. It is considered a strong 'fluid ability' measure, with performance reaching a peak in early adulthood and declining across the life span. It involves recalling increasingly lengthy series of illustrated objects and activities that are presented in a particular order on the computer screen. Age-Adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band. "
CardSort_Unadj,NIH Toolbox Dimensional Change Card Sort Test: Unadjusted Scale Score,"The Dimensional Change Card Sort Test is a measure of executive function, specifically tapping cognitive flexibility for ages 3-85. It is considered a 'fluid ability' measure, with performance generally increasing through childhood and then declining across the adult age span. Target pictures are presented that vary along two dimensions (e.g., shape and color). Participants are asked to match a series of bivalent test pictures (e.g., yellow balls and blue trucks) to the target pictures, first according to one dimension (e.g., color) and then, after a number of trials, according to the other dimension (e.g., shape). Switch trials are also employed, in which the participant must change the dimension being matched, thus requiring the cognitive flexibility to quickly choose the correct stimulus. Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time. Unadjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed to those in the entire NIH Toolbox Normative Sample (18 and older), regardless of age or any other variable, where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average. "
Flanker_Unadj,NIH Toolbox Flanker Inhibitory Control and Attention Test: Unadjusted Scale Score,"The Flanker is a measure of executive function, specifically tapping inhibitory control and attention for ages 3-85. It is considered a fluid ability measure (i.e. measures the capacity for new learning and information processing in novel situations) in which performance reaches a peak in early adulthood, then tends to decline across the life span. The test requires the participant to focus on a given stimulus while inhibiting attention to stimuli (arrows for ages 8-85) flanking it. Sometimes the middle stimulus is pointing in the same direction as the flankers (congruent) and sometimes in the opposite direction (incongruent). Scoring is based on a combination of accuracy and reaction time. Unadjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed to those in the entire NIH Toolbox Normative Sample (18 and older), regardless of age or any other variable, where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average.

PMAT24_A_SI,Penn Progressive Matrices: Total Skipped Items (PMAT24_A_SI),"Penn Matrix Test (PMAT): Total Skipped Items (items not presented because maximum errors allowed reached [5 in a row]). The PMAT measures fluid intelligence via non-verbal reasoning using an abbreviated version of the Raven's Progressive Matrices Form A developed by Gur and colleagues (Bilker et al. 2012).  Participants are presented with patterns made up of 2x2, 3x3 or 1x5 arrangements of squares, with one of the squares missing.  The participant must pick one of five response choices that best fits the missing square on the pattern.  The task has 24 items and 3 bonus items, arranged in order of increasing difficulty.  However, the task discontinues if the participant makes 5 incorrect responses in a row."
ReadEng_Unadj,NIH Toolbox Oral Reading Recognition Test: Unadjusted Scale Score,"The Reading Test is a CAT format measure of reading decoding skill and of crystallized abilities, those abilities that are generally more dependent upon past learning experiences and consistent across the life span for ages 7-85.

Unadjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed to those in the entire NIH Toolbox Normative Sample (18 and older), regardless of age or any other variable, where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average."

The participant is presented with an audio recording of a word and four photographic images on the computer screen and is asked to select the picture that most closely matches the meaning of the word. Higher scores indicate higher vocabulary ability. Unadjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed to those in the entire NIH Toolbox Normative Sample (18 and older), regardless of age or any other variable, where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average.

ProcSpeed_AgeAdj,NIH Toolbox Pattern Comparison Processing Speed Test: Age-Adjusted Scale Score,"The Pattern Comparison Processing Test is a measure of speed of processing, which is considered a 'fluid ability' because it steadily improves (time to complete task decreases) throughout childhood and adolescence, then begins to decline in adulthood. This test for ages 7-85 asks participants to discern whether two side-by-side pictures are the same or not. The items are designed to be simple to most purely measure processing speed. Age-Adjusted Scale Score: Participant score is normed using the age appropriate band of Toolbox Norming Sample (bands of ages 18-29, or 30-35), where a score of 100 indicates performance that was at the national average and a score of 115 or 85, indicates performance 1 SD above or below the national average for participants age band.

DDisc_SV_6mo_40K,Delay Discounting: Subjective Value for $40K at 6 months (DDisc_SV_6mo_40K),"Delay Discounting: Subjective Value for $40K at 6 months. Participants choice of an immediate amount that is equivalent to receiving $40000 in 6 months. In this task, participants are presented with two choices on each trial - a smaller amount today or $40K in 6 months. Using an adjusting-amount approach, delays are fixed and reward amounts are adjusted on a trial-by-trial basis based on participants choices, to rapidly hone in on an indifference point that indicates the Subjective immediate Value of $40K in 6 months. Delay discounting describes the undervaluing of rewards that are delayed in time. It is illustrated by the fact that humans (and other animals) will often choose a smaller immediate reward over an objectively larger, but delayed reward. "

Noise_Comp,NIH Toolbox Words-In-Noise Age 6+: Computed Score,"This test measures a person ability to recognize single words presented amid varying levels of background noise. It measures how much difficulty a person might have hearing in a noisy environment. A percent correct is calculated, which is then translated into a threshold score for each ear, in decibels of signal-to-noise ratio (dB S/N), using a look-up table. The range of possible scores for each ear is -2.0 to 26.0 dB S/N, with lower scores indicative of better performance and, conversely, higher scores potentially suggestive of hearing difficulties. Note: HCP has used two versions of the NIH Toolbox WIN test (V1 and V2). In V1 the audio output was through a sound card and equalizer that is no longer supported and in V2 the audio output goes straight through the headphone jack worn by the participant. HCP switched from V1 to V2 WIN on January 23, 2015, so all Q1-S500 Subjects were administered V1 and most S900+ Subjects were administered V2."
